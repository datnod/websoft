            <p>Assignment 01: </p>

            <p>Did you before know about the techniques Git, GitHub, Markdown and/or GitHub Pages?</p>
            <p>I have known about Git and GitHub, the rest is new to me. I am accustomed to using built-in git push and pull on Intellij IDEA but Git bash also works fine with using a text editor. Though when it comes to using Markdown such as HTML, we have
                not used that so much until we got to third year. The GitHub pages is also a new experience for me.
            </p>

            <p>Have you ever created websites before?</p>
            <p>No I haven't, this is why I am excited. I have done some web related things in a previous course. RESTful API where we set up a Glassfish or Tomcat server to host locally. But mainly we used Tomcat or Glassfish to set up a java client to communicate
                to the server instead of using the browser.
            </p>

            <p>Briefly explain your experience and knowledge of web application development.</p>
            <p>I have no experience in web application besides some very simple applications. Such as RESTful Java Application with Tomcat Server.</p>

            <p>What is your TIL for this course section?</p>
            <p>Well it stands for "Today I learned", which I learned today that TIL. Learning to use Git Bash more and also that I got a warning of using password will be deprecated soon. Meaning that tokens are recomended, so I learned about that. For this
                course from Lecture 1, I learned that we're going to use several techniques such as PHP with MySQL. Also learning JavaScript with HTML.

            <p>Assignment 02: </p>

            <p>Have you any previous experience of HTML, CSS and/or JavaScript?</p>
            <p>No I haven't really used any of these before. I have heard of them often but we never had courses on them. It will be nice to learn about HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</p>

            <p>Explain the role of HTML, CSS and JavaScript in web development:</p>
            <p>HTML is the standard langauge markup langauge for websites. At the moment I have not read up on Markup so much yet. I know HTML is one such example but I am not used to it. CSS is used for making better looking websites. JavaScript is a programming
                langauge, used for coding logic on for instance in this case the web browser, like how things are built up via the browser.</p>

            <p>Give a brief explanation of how the browser, the HTTP protocol and the web server interacts:</p>
            <p>The browser is the client application that that person is using. And through it he or she can interact through the web. With requests and responses sent through TCP/IP and HTTP is the protocol. Which decides how it works for a URL syntax,
                like the http://www.address_here.com:port_here/queries_here. The client communicates through the internet and connects to a website through the web, that is a vast network of networks.</p>

            <p>What is your TIL for this course section?</p>
            <p>TIL'ed that HTML5 has some changes done with semantic elements to differienate like fonters and articles. I also learned that it is proper to define which charset the browser should read the document, it is a good practice. Even if it is not
                as important today as it was years ago it is still good to be aware of it in general.

            <h2>S03</h2>
            <p>Assignment 3</p>
            <p>Do you have any previous experience of client side JavaScript?</p>
            <p>I do not have any previous experience in JS. However it has been made possible to code in it as knowing programming in general helps to learn new languages easier</p>
            <p>Can you compare and relate the JavaScript language to any other language you know?</p>
            <p>Yes I can compare JavaScript programming language since it is a programming language, it has similar logic in some areas such as with Java but from what I have learned is that instead of defining specific data types you can just define them
                as var for variables or function for methods. Some things like binding a function from a js file to a html button for example is new for me also while the concept of it is not hard, it can be tricky for the first time. </p>
            <p>Describe how you worked with the coding exercise, what grade do you aim for and how did your code turn out to be?
            </p>
            <p>I worked alone on it for grade 3, since I have fallen behind schedule and due to both studying and working full time at the same time, I decided a grade 3 for now was sufficient. I followed by example by watching the lecture slides through
                youtube as I havenâ€™t been able to attend them all. Then after I started the assignment and took my time. My code turned out alright while it is not perfect it works.</p>
            <p>What is your TIL for this course section? </p>
            <p>i learned that JavaScript can be used very differently than Java and that is interesting. I also learned more about HTML and CSS, such as using id defined by me to manipulate how they can behave in javascript, like when I move an object depending
                on the pixels if it reaches too high or too low for x and y i can prevent them by if statements so that the object stays within my screen. I learned that XAMPP does not update cache automatically and as such I installed Live Server for
                VSCode which does it automatically and is very easy to use. I learned that CSS is very useful as well for styling all kinds of elements such as tables which made it structured for me afterwards.

            <h2>S04</h2>
            <p>Assignment 4</p>
            <p>Tell me about your previous experience on node/npm or any equal programming tools.</p>
            <p>I have never used npm or node before, however I can relate to some of it for example with Raspbian for Raspberry Pi 3, You had to in a sense install different modules/packages for programs work, but thats all that I can relate here to. I havent
                really any kind of experience when it comes to node and npm, I am not even sure if Raspbian is comparable to begin with but thats what I thought of when I was working with node/npm.
            </p>

            <p>How do you feel about working with JavaScript, Node and Express?</p>
            <p>I like how diffeent JavaScript is to Java despite it sounding similar, of course you can apply Java programming logic to JavaScript but there are some variations and these things can throw me off a bit even if I know exactly how I want to
                build my application. I am rather intrigued by node and express but I find it hard to properly manage folders with having installed express ejs to the right work folder. However in the end I made it work despite some difficulties when
                it came to EJS, express itself is wonderful and feels really powerful for what it can do with EJS.
            </p>

            <p>Explain how you did take on the coding assignment, did you have a plan and did it work?</p>
            <p>My take on this assignment is that I will take whatever time I need even if I may fall behind, as it is all new for me and I am a slow learner. However I did plan by doing the excersise and watch your lecture on youtube and my lotto I made
                a simple test on Java before implementing that step in JavaScript. My plan for the most part went smooth, but I had an issue with views folder not being found which of course I solved by setting a new _dirname for the new views folder
                i had made for a04, I am aware that I would rather not have this issue in the future. Other than that it went well. </p>

            <p>What grade did you aim for and was it difficult level?</p>
            <p>I am for now aiming for individual assignments for grade 3. I do this mainly because of I work 165+ h a month while at the same time studying full time which can be stressful on me.</p>

            <p>What is your TIL for this course section?</p>
            <p> Well a lot in fact, such as Express + Node for webpages using JavaScript. A few other things as well such as middleware and routes, that you can structure it in that way to make it look good and easy.</p>
