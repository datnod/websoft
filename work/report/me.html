<h1>My report page for the course DA377B</h1>

<p><img src="img/DSC_0100.JPG" height="400" alt="Liri" ></p>

<p>This is my report-page in the course. This page contains a presentation of myself. Keep this site updated all through the course and hand it in, for grading, in the end of the course.</p>

<p>An introduction of myself.
    My name is Liridon Smailji but I prefer to write my last name, inofficialy Smajli due to spelling error when my parents moved to sweden in the early 90s.
    I was born in 1994 and I enjoy a lot of things related with computers, while I am new still to programming it can be very fun to do when I have a good understanding of what I am actually doing.
    I grew up in Höör, Skåne but was born in Örnsköldsvik.
    I currently work as a personal assistant and study att full time concurrently.</p>


<p> A hobby of mine is reading or watching manga, I also enjoy reading fantasy books or novels occasionaly.
    I am a big fan of gaming such as dark souls as it contains a lot of hidden details.</p>


<p>I look forward to learning and going through this course, and I will try to be active on Gitter Chatt!</p>
