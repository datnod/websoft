        <h1>My report page for the course DA377B</h1>

        <p><img src="img/liri.JPG"  alt="Liri" class="responsive"></p>

        <p>This is my report-page in the course. This page contains a presentation of myself. Keep this site updated all
            through the course and hand it in, for grading, in the end of the course.</p>

        <p>An introduction of myself.
            My name is Liridon Smailji but I prefer to write my last name, inofficialy Smajli due to spelling error when
            my parents moved to sweden in the early 90s.
            I was born in 1994 and I enjoy a lot of things related with computers, while I am new still to programming
            it can be very fun to do when I have a good understanding of what I am actually doing.
            I grew up in Höör, Skåne but was born in Örnsköldsvik.
            I currently work as a personal assistant and study att full time concurrently.</p>


        <p> A hobby of mine is reading or watching manga, I also enjoy reading fantasy books or novels occasionaly.
            I am a big fan of gaming such as dark souls and the witcher as it contains a lot of hidden details.
            Another interest I have is technology it is fun to test things and see how they work.
            I prefer using a gaming laptop instead of a stationary as I find it gives me more options when moving
            between locations.
            Nowadays I do not have as much time as before so I don't often play games a lot anymore due to working and
            studying full time. </p>


        <p>I look forward to learning and going through this course, and I will try to be active on Gitter Chatt!</p>
