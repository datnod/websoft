            <h2>S01</h2>
            <p>Assignment 01: </p>

            <p>Did you before know about the techniques Git, GitHub, Markdown and/or GitHub Pages?</p>
            <p>I have known about Git and GitHub, the rest is new to me. I am accustomed to using built-in git push and pull on Intellij IDEA but Git bash also works fine with using a text editor. Though when it comes to using Markdown such as HTML, we have
                not used that so much until we got to third year. The GitHub pages is also a new experience for me.
            </p>

            <p>Have you ever created websites before?</p>
            <p>No I haven't, this is why I am excited. I have done some web related things in a previous course. RESTful API where we set up a Glassfish or Tomcat server to host locally. But mainly we used Tomcat or Glassfish to set up a java client to communicate
                to the server instead of using the browser.
            </p>

            <p>Briefly explain your experience and knowledge of web application development.</p>
            <p>I have no experience in web application besides some very simple applications. Such as RESTful Java Application with Tomcat Server.</p>

            <p>What is your TIL for this course section?</p>
            <p>Well it stands for "Today I learned", which I learned today that TIL. Learning to use Git Bash more and also that I got a warning of using password will be deprecated soon. Meaning that tokens are recomended, so I learned about that. For this
                course from Lecture 1, I learned that we're going to use several techniques such as PHP with MySQL. Also learning JavaScript with HTML.

            <h2>S02</h2>
            <p>Assignment 02: </p>

            <p>Have you any previous experience of HTML, CSS and/or JavaScript?</p>
            <p>No I haven't really used any of these before. I have heard of them often but we never had courses on them. It will be nice to learn about HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</p>

            <p>Explain the role of HTML, CSS and JavaScript in web development:</p>
            <p>HTML is the standard langauge markup langauge for websites. At the moment I have not read up on Markup so much yet. I know HTML is one such example but I am not used to it. CSS is used for making better looking websites. JavaScript is a programming
                langauge, used for coding logic on for instance in this case the web browser, like how things are built up via the browser.</p>

            <p>Give a brief explanation of how the browser, the HTTP protocol and the web server interacts:</p>
            <p>The browser is the client application that that person is using. And through it he or she can interact through the web. With requests and responses sent through TCP/IP and HTTP is the protocol. Which decides how it works for a URL syntax,
                like the http://www.address_here.com:port_here/queries_here. The client communicates through the internet and connects to a website through the web, that is a vast network of networks.</p>

            <p>What is your TIL for this course section?</p>
            <p>TIL'ed that HTML5 has some changes done with semantic elements to differienate like fonters and articles. I also learned that it is proper to define which charset the browser should read the document, it is a good practice. Even if it is not
                as important today as it was years ago it is still good to be aware of it in general.
            </p>

            <h2>S03</h2>
            <p>Assignment 3</p>
            <p>Do you have any previous experience of client side JavaScript?</p>
            <p>I do not have any previous experience in JS. However it has been made possible to code in it as knowing programming in general helps to learn new languages easier</p>
            <p>Can you compare and relate the JavaScript language to any other language you know?</p>
            <p>Yes I can compare JavaScript programming language since it is a programming language, it has similar logic in some areas such as with Java but from what I have learned is that instead of defining specific data types you can just define them
                as var for variables or function for methods. Some things like binding a function from a js file to a html button for example is new for me also while the concept of it is not hard, it can be tricky for the first time. </p>
            <p>Describe how you worked with the coding exercise, what grade do you aim for and how did your code turn out to be?
            </p>
            <p>I worked alone on it for grade 3, since I have fallen behind schedule and due to both studying and working full time at the same time, I decided a grade 3 for now was sufficient. I followed by example by watching the lecture slides through
                youtube as I haven’t been able to attend them all. Then after I started the assignment and took my time. My code turned out alright while it is not perfect it works.</p>
            <p>What is your TIL for this course section? </p>
            <p>i learned that JavaScript can be used very differently than Java and that is interesting. I also learned more about HTML and CSS, such as using id defined by me to manipulate how they can behave in javascript, like when I move an object depending
                on the pixels if it reaches too high or too low for x and y i can prevent them by if statements so that the object stays within my screen. I learned that XAMPP does not update cache automatically and as such I installed Live Server for
                VSCode which does it automatically and is very easy to use. I learned that CSS is very useful as well for styling all kinds of elements such as tables which made it structured for me afterwards.
            </p>

            <h2>S04</h2>
            <p>Assignment 4</p>
            <p>Tell me about your previous experience on node/npm or any equal programming tools.</p>
            <p>I have never used npm or node before, however I can relate to some of it for example with Raspbian for Raspberry Pi 3, You had to in a sense install different modules/packages for programs work, but thats all that I can relate here to. I havent
                really any kind of experience when it comes to node and npm, I am not even sure if Raspbian is comparable to begin with but thats what I thought of when I was working with node/npm.
            </p>

            <p>How do you feel about working with JavaScript, Node and Express?</p>
            <p>I like how diffeent JavaScript is to Java despite it sounding similar, of course you can apply Java programming logic to JavaScript but there are some variations and these things can throw me off a bit even if I know exactly how I want to
                build my application. I am rather intrigued by node and express but I find it hard to properly manage folders with having installed express ejs to the right work folder. However in the end I made it work despite some difficulties when
                it came to EJS, express itself is wonderful and feels really powerful for what it can do with EJS.
            </p>

            <p>Explain how you did take on the coding assignment, did you have a plan and did it work?</p>
            <p>My take on this assignment is that I will take whatever time I need even if I may fall behind, as it is all new for me and I am a slow learner. However I did plan by doing the excersise and watch your lecture on youtube and my lotto I made
                a simple test on Java before implementing that step in JavaScript. My plan for the most part went smooth, but I had an issue with views folder not being found which of course I solved by setting a new _dirname for the new views folder
                i had made for a04, I am aware that I would rather not have this issue in the future. Other than that it went well. </p>

            <p>What grade did you aim for and was it difficult level?</p>
            <p>I am for now aiming for individual assignments for grade 3. I do this mainly because of I work 165+ h a month while at the same time studying full time which can be stressful on me.</p>

            <p>What is your TIL for this course section?</p>
            <p> Well a lot in fact, such as Express + Node for webpages using JavaScript. A few other things as well such as middleware and routes, that you can structure it in that way to make it look good and easy.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>S05</h2>
            <p>Assignment 5</p>
            <p>How do you feel about PHP as a programming language?</p>
            <p>I will be honest, it is kinda confusing and very different from what I am used to with Java. I sense some similarites with JavaScript when it comes to PHP as a programming langauge. I find it a bit difficult because it is unlike Java but documentation
                makes it easier to bridge the gap. </p>
            <p>Can you compare PHP to other languages you know?</p>
            <p> I guess the most comparable I can think of is JavaScript even if it is not the same it feels similar. I cannot really compare it to Java or so even if php uses if statements and such it feels to different.</p>
            <p>Describe how you took on the coding exercise, what grade did you aim for and are you satisfied with the result?</p>
            <p>Well I had already installed XAMPP a long time before, but since I already had MySQL installed. I figured I would use that instead of installing another DB on XAMPP. I had some issues with port taken but the reason for this was I had already
                installed MySQL and I fiddled with it by installing a XAMPP MySQL version. And it did nothing that my current MySQL could not do so I uninstalled it and just rebinded my PATH for MySQL so I could run it in CMD. I followed the guidelines
                for the excersise and watched the lectures on YouTube meanwhile. And I also used MySQL Workbench to edit my a coloumn for adding ID and make it a PK + AI as per instructions, With 3 coloumns + 7 rows. In total I would say 2h-3h hours.
            </p>
            <p>What is your TIL for this course section?</p>
            <p>Hmm, well declaring variables using PHP and P0D for connecting to MySQL. Also that it can use variables for methods like JavaScript. Some other things I learned are SQL queries on how they ben be saved in a script using php. I learned that
                XAMPP is not really all that useful if a person already have the programs installed, such as MySQL or Apache.

            <h2>S06</h2>
            <p>Assignment 6</p>
            <p>What is your own opinion on popularity of programming languages and what are your thoughts of future popularity among programming languages?</p>
            <p>My opinion on trending or popular programming languages represent for me the current programming languages available as a developer seeking work and are probably highly sought over by companies looking for programmers, they probably have some
                expectations at the very least. I believe that Kotlin is a programming language that will in the coming years perhaps overtake a large part of Java when it comes to mobile Android. My thoughts on the future popularity is that it reflects
                upon the preference on programmers and what is convenient and useful regarding easier implementation and less stressful on the on system. Such as Kotlin being an example I mentioned.</p>
            <p>What will be your own choice for selecting future programming languages?</p>
            <p>I am very open-minded to try out different programming languages, perhaps give JavaScript and PHP a good try, as these are very new experience for me, that is used to Java only and since I am used to Java I might look for a job regarding Java.
                And from there expand my preferences wherever that may go for getting employed or being relevant in the workplace.</p>
            <p>Do your own investigation on https://trends.google.com ,to customize your own comparison on programming languages (or frameworks) and elaborate on the results.</p>
            <p>My comparison is that of JavaScript, PHP, Java. The results are parts of Europe such as Sweden, Norway, Brittain, France is the most popular language and in second place comes Java with and then the least is PHP not as popular as I thought
                it would be. Some countries like USA, Italy, Germany, China is most popular with Java. While the only country with PHP being popular is Indonesia, the rest of the world are very popular with JavaScript and Java both being around 40-50%
                each in these countries and PHP in the lesser than 10-20%.</p>
            <p>If you were to recommend a language/framework/technology to your potential employer and your next large project, what would it be and how would you “sell it”?</p>
            <p>It would be JavaScript, I would try to sell it as a popular programming language that is widely used, and it could be for any type of website and that we should have a foot inside this market as to not fall behind the trend.</p>
            <p>What is your TIL for this course section?</p>
            <p>Answer: I have learned that both PHP and JavaScript have similarities and are widely used, but that JavaScript is more in use than PHP and for my case, knowing Java, I decided to look into this one as well and both Java and JavaScript where
                quite popular with 5-10% in difference only in popularity while PHP was much less used especially in Europe. Another thing I learned was that the frameworks are much pretty much coding environments with differences to vanilla versions.
                CMS are not just used by programmers but also by users. </p>
