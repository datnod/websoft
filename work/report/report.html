            <h2>S01</h2>
            <p>Assignment 01: </p>

            <p>Did you before know about the techniques Git, GitHub, Markdown and/or GitHub Pages?</p>
            <p>I have known about Git and GitHub, the rest is new to me. I am accustomed to using built-in git push and pull on Intellij IDEA but Git bash also works fine with using a text editor. Though when it comes to using Markdown such as HTML, we have
                not used that so much until we got to third year. The GitHub pages is also a new experience for me.
            </p>

            <p>Have you ever created websites before?</p>
            <p>No I haven't, this is why I am excited. I have done some web related things in a previous course. RESTful API where we set up a Glassfish or Tomcat server to host locally. But mainly we used Tomcat or Glassfish to set up a java client to communicate
                to the server instead of using the browser.
            </p>

            <p>Briefly explain your experience and knowledge of web application development.</p>
            <p>I have no experience in web application besides some very simple applications. Such as RESTful Java Application with Tomcat Server.</p>

            <p>What is your TIL for this course section?</p>
            <p>Well it stands for "Today I learned", which I learned today that TIL. Learning to use Git Bash more and also that I got a warning of using password will be deprecated soon. Meaning that tokens are recomended, so I learned about that. For this
                course from Lecture 1, I learned that we're going to use several techniques such as PHP with MySQL. Also learning JavaScript with HTML.
            </p>

            <h2>S02</h2>
            <p>Assignment 02: </p>

            <p>Have you any previous experience of HTML, CSS and/or JavaScript?</p>
            <p>No I haven't really used any of these before. I have heard of them often but we never had courses on them. It will be nice to learn about HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</p>

            <p>Explain the role of HTML, CSS and JavaScript in web development:</p>
            <p>HTML is the standard langauge markup langauge for websites. At the moment I have not read up on Markup so much yet. I know HTML is one such example but I am not used to it. CSS is used for making better looking websites. JavaScript is a programming
                langauge, used for coding logic on for instance in this case the web browser, like how things are built up via the browser.</p>

            <p>Give a brief explanation of how the browser, the HTTP protocol and the web server interacts:</p>
            <p>The browser is the client application that that person is using. And through it he or she can interact through the web. With requests and responses sent through TCP/IP and HTTP is the protocol. Which decides how it works for a URL syntax,
                like the http://www.address_here.com:port_here/queries_here. The client communicates through the internet and connects to a website through the web, that is a vast network of networks.</p>

            <p>What is your TIL for this course section?</p>
            <p>TIL'ed that HTML5 has some changes done with semantic elements to differienate like fonters and articles. I also learned that it is proper to define which charset the browser should read the document, it is a good practice. Even if it is not
                as important today as it was years ago it is still good to be aware of it in general.
            </p>

            <h2>S03</h2>
            <p>Assignment 3</p>
            <p>Do you have any previous experience of client side JavaScript?</p>
            <p>I do not have any previous experience in JS. However it has been made possible to code in it as knowing programming in general helps to learn new languages easier</p>
            <p>Can you compare and relate the JavaScript language to any other language you know?</p>
            <p>Yes I can compare JavaScript programming language since it is a programming language, it has similar logic in some areas such as with Java but from what I have learned is that instead of defining specific data types you can just define them
                as var for variables or function for methods. Some things like binding a function from a js file to a html button for example is new for me also while the concept of it is not hard, it can be tricky for the first time. </p>
            <p>Describe how you worked with the coding exercise, what grade do you aim for and how did your code turn out to be?
            </p>
            <p>I worked alone on it for grade 3, since I have fallen behind schedule and due to both studying and working full time at the same time, I decided a grade 3 for now was sufficient. I followed by example by watching the lecture slides through
                youtube as I haven’t been able to attend them all. Then after I started the assignment and took my time. My code turned out alright while it is not perfect it works.</p>
            <p>What is your TIL for this course section? </p>
            <p>i learned that JavaScript can be used very differently than Java and that is interesting. I also learned more about HTML and CSS, such as using id defined by me to manipulate how they can behave in javascript, like when I move an object depending
                on the pixels if it reaches too high or too low for x and y i can prevent them by if statements so that the object stays within my screen. I learned that XAMPP does not update cache automatically and as such I installed Live Server for
                VSCode which does it automatically and is very easy to use. I learned that CSS is very useful as well for styling all kinds of elements such as tables which made it structured for me afterwards.
            </p>

        <section>
            <h2>S04</h2>
            <p>Assignment 4</p>
            <p>Tell me about your previous experience on node/npm or any equal programming tools.</p>
            <p>I have never used npm or node before, however I can relate to some of it for example with Raspbian for Raspberry Pi 3, You had to in a sense install different modules/packages for programs work, but thats all that I can relate here to. I havent
                really any kind of experience when it comes to node and npm, I am not even sure if Raspbian is comparable to begin with but thats what I thought of when I was working with node/npm.
            </p>

            <p>How do you feel about working with JavaScript, Node and Express?</p>
            <p>I like how diffeent JavaScript is to Java despite it sounding similar, of course you can apply Java programming logic to JavaScript but there are some variations and these things can throw me off a bit even if I know exactly how I want to
                build my application. I am rather intrigued by node and express but I find it hard to properly manage folders with having installed express ejs to the right work folder. However in the end I made it work despite some difficulties when
                it came to EJS, express itself is wonderful and feels really powerful for what it can do with EJS.
            </p>

            <p>Explain how you did take on the coding assignment, did you have a plan and did it work?</p>
            <p>My take on this assignment is that I will take whatever time I need even if I may fall behind, as it is all new for me and I am a slow learner. However I did plan by doing the excersise and watch your lecture on youtube and my lotto I made
                a simple test on Java before implementing that step in JavaScript. My plan for the most part went smooth, but I had an issue with views folder not being found which of course I solved by setting a new _dirname for the new views folder
                i had made for a04, I am aware that I would rather not have this issue in the future. Other than that it went well. </p>

            <p>What grade did you aim for and was it difficult level?</p>
            <p>I am for now aiming for individual assignments for grade 3. I do this mainly because of I work 165+ h a month while at the same time studying full time which can be stressful on me.</p>

            <p>What is your TIL for this course section?</p>
            <p> Well a lot in fact, such as Express + Node for webpages using JavaScript. A few other things as well such as middleware and routes, that you can structure it in that way to make it look good and easy.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>S05</h2>
            <p>Assignment 5</p>
            <p>How do you feel about PHP as a programming language?</p>
            <p>I will be honest, it is kinda confusing and very different from what I am used to with Java. I sense some similarites with JavaScript when it comes to PHP as a programming langauge. I find it a bit difficult because it is unlike Java but documentation
                makes it easier to bridge the gap. </p>
            <p>Can you compare PHP to other languages you know?</p>
            <p> I guess the most comparable I can think of is JavaScript even if it is not the same it feels similar. I cannot really compare it to Java or so even if php uses if statements and such it feels to different.</p>
            <p>Describe how you took on the coding exercise, what grade did you aim for and are you satisfied with the result?</p>
            <p>Well I had already installed XAMPP a long time before, but since I already had MySQL installed. I figured I would use that instead of installing another DB on XAMPP. I had some issues with port taken but the reason for this was I had already
                installed MySQL and I fiddled with it by installing a XAMPP MySQL version. And it did nothing that my current MySQL could not do so I uninstalled it and just rebinded my PATH for MySQL so I could run it in CMD. I followed the guidelines
                for the excersise and watched the lectures on YouTube meanwhile. And I also used MySQL Workbench to edit my a coloumn for adding ID and make it a PK + AI as per instructions, With 3 coloumns + 7 rows. In total I would say 2h-3h hours.
            </p>
            <p>What is your TIL for this course section?</p>
            <p>Hmm, well declaring variables using PHP and P0D for connecting to MySQL. Also that it can use variables for methods like JavaScript. Some other things I learned are SQL queries on how they ben be saved in a script using php. I learned that
                XAMPP is not really all that useful if a person already have the programs installed, such as MySQL or Apache.

            <h2>S06</h2>
            <p>Assignment 6</p>
            <p>What is your own opinion on popularity of programming languages and what are your thoughts of future popularity among programming languages?</p>
            <p>My opinion on trending or popular programming languages represent for me the current programming languages available as a developer seeking work and are probably highly sought over by companies looking for programmers, they probably have some
                expectations at the very least. I believe that Kotlin is a programming language that will in the coming years perhaps overtake a large part of Java when it comes to mobile Android. My thoughts on the future popularity is that it reflects
                upon the preference on programmers and what is convenient and useful regarding easier implementation and less stressful on the on system. Such as Kotlin being an example I mentioned.</p>
            <p>What will be your own choice for selecting future programming languages?</p>
            <p>I am very open-minded to try out different programming languages, perhaps give JavaScript and PHP a good try, as these are very new experience for me, that is used to Java only and since I am used to Java I might look for a job regarding Java.
                And from there expand my preferences wherever that may go for getting employed or being relevant in the workplace.</p>
            <p>Do your own investigation on https://trends.google.com ,to customize your own comparison on programming languages (or frameworks) and elaborate on the results.</p>
            <p>My comparison is that of JavaScript, PHP, Java. The results are parts of Europe such as Sweden, Norway, Brittain, France is the most popular language and in second place comes Java with and then the least is PHP not as popular as I thought
                it would be. Some countries like USA, Italy, Germany, China is most popular with Java. While the only country with PHP being popular is Indonesia, the rest of the world are very popular with JavaScript and Java both being around 40-50%
                each in these countries and PHP in the lesser than 10-20%.</p>
            <p>If you were to recommend a language/framework/technology to your potential employer and your next large project, what would it be and how would you “sell it”?</p>
            <p>It would be JavaScript, I would try to sell it as a popular programming language that is widely used, and it could be for any type of website and that we should have a foot inside this market as to not fall behind the trend.</p>
            <p>What is your TIL for this course section?</p>
            <p>Answer: I have learned that both PHP and JavaScript have similarities and are widely used, but that JavaScript is more in use than PHP and for my case, knowing Java, I decided to look into this one as well and both Java and JavaScript where
                quite popular with 5-10% in difference only in popularity while PHP was much less used especially in Europe. Another thing I learned was that the frameworks are much pretty much coding environments with differences to vanilla versions.
                CMS are not just used by programmers but also by users. </p>

            <h2>S07</h2>
            <p>Try to explain the platform .NET (C#, ASP.NET) to a skilled programmer, but newbie to this Microsoft technology.</p>
            <p>I would say .NET is the console version of executing a program coded with C Sharp. It is fairly similar to Java. 
                Also ASP.NET is a subset of .NET Core which is the kit for developing websites through C Sharp using Microsoft's framework. </p>
            
            <p>Elaborate by comparing .NET technologies with the other technologies we learned during the course.</p>
            <p>.NET seems fairly similar to nodejs for launching code through the terminal but I wouldnt say it is the same.
                The part I find similar to NodeJS is that you can launch the code inside the same folder of said program.
                Then there is ASP.NET which is part of .NET Core and is the web development version of .NET for websites which is comparable
                with Express since it is for websites also.
            </p>

            <p>Describe how you took on the coding exercise, what grade did you aim for and are you satisfied with the result?</p>
            <p>I watched the Tutorials of 101 from Microsoft on Youtube. I also watched the slides/lecture. I did the tutorials on Microsoft. I then started installing needed SDKs for C sharp and framework. I coded the console version first and then the webapp and it for 
                the most part console went fine but the webapp was a bit harder eventually i solved it through example code.</p>
            
            <p>What is your TIL for this course section?</p>
            <p>I learned how to somewhat code with a different environment but still compare it greatly to Java which made me feel at ease.
             I got learn .NET overall and I quite like it. ASP.NET was also fun but it was very confusing as none of it compares to Java but with help from code examples and lecture I understood the overall structure and startup of it.
             I also found out that making more controllers for routes was possible. And re-using same model for it, namely Account.
             Running it with dotnet watch run made it continously update itself which made debugging easier.

            <h2>S08</h2>
            <p>Assignment 8</p>
            <p>Group members: Oskar Forssman, Liridon Smajli, Henrik Vihlborg</p>
            <p>Chosen pages: Blocket (Oskar), Aftonbladet (Liridon), HKR (Henrik)</p>
            <p>Data sheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cXB8Q30yARvPpxOt7vSUHlE9bKbWzlKaMRxOq5YOwT8/</p>
            <p>HKR.se was chosen since it is the university we go to.

                HKR.se seems to be much faster than the other two. It uses best practice a clear majority of the time.
                The best improvement according to the tools from google is to preload resources. This would speed up things quite a bit.
                </p>
            <p>Aftonbladet was chosen because it is a popular site for news and it was interesting to see how it would hold up in terms of performance when it came to visiting their website.

                The site Aftonbladet suffers mainly from two things: using document.write a lot and having pictures with the wrong aspect ratio.
                This leads to the main thread being overused and slowing down the loading of the site.</p>
            <p>Blocket was chosen because we like to sell stuff there. Its a site simply with ads both and it was interesting to see how it held up to the others with performance.

                The site Blocket suffers from the vast amount of ads that get published all the time. The tools used recommend to update to http2 and fix so the images are in correct aspect ratio.</p>
            
            <p>What is your TIL for this course section?</p>
            <p>Some new terms and ways of analayzing data from these three ways of benchmarking a website and best practices for understanding what to improve on. It can be useful if I make an actual site in the future</p>

            <h2>S09</h2>
            <p>Assignment 9</p>
            <p>Elaborate on a few (3-5) different security issues or concerns, from your own experience, related to web application security and relate them to the OWASP top ten.</p>
            <p>In my past experiences in development of programs. I have learned that never to use statements but preparedstatements instead. Also making to hash and salt the user credentials for authentication to be kept safe. Then avoid having backdoors that people can abuse. 
            So for these I would relate to OSAWP 10 are: Injections, Broken authentication, Broken access control. So in testing and debugging in deveolpment I usually make easier ways of accessing database and programs but these ways can be harmful for final product so to have it removed is necessary becuase they are not safe.</p>
            
            <p>Summarize by providing your own guidelines to a new web programmer on the topic “The essential guidelines to follow to create secure web applications”.</p>
            <p>To avoid leaving sensitive data available by separating development and testing and production, which require certain privilegies or log in credentials. Also backdoors for files and source code such as leaving a sensitive project available on GitHub for anyone to find public. There should be an administrator for handling the system and not give more privilegies than needed for a normal user. And make sure that the error logs dont give out certain credentials for instance, accessing the database. Then also to keep dependencies and tools updated to avoid security flaws. Such as using the latest JDBC for MySQL in Java.</p>
            
            <p>What is your TIL for this course section?</p>
            <p>My TIL is understanding a bit more of security flaws precented and how serious it can be like for instance having financial issues from being attacked by hackers and the outcome that is may have on customers dependent on your service and might in the future not be a customer from reasons like these. For instance Reddit was hacked before and had their DB exposed and it was found out that all the passwords and usernames where not encrypted at all but just in plain text.</p>

            <h2>Assignment 10</h2>
            <p>Write a general paragraph about how the project was implemented. Problems / solutions / simple / difficult / fast / long time, etc. Was the project easy or difficult? Did it take a long time? What was difficult and what went easy? Was this a good and reasonable project for this course? How was it to work in a team? <br>
                <br>
                We had chosen a simple idea for making a website, which was IMDB lookalike but for games, We decided to use PHP and NodeJS but eventually took PHP. The project itself was somewhat hard it wasn’t that it took long time it was more that we didn’t know how PHP worked like how we know Java or even JavaScript. We had for instance problems with making a dynamic page for php it just didn’t work the same as with JavaScript. For the most part the project was easy except a few areas. It did take some time due to the fact that we have degree thesis ongoing and midterm soon on the way. I would say the most difficult thing was for grade 4 which we almost did but decided to wrap since we didn’t know how to make all 4 operations of CRUD in 1 hidden php file dynamic and not using several files even though it could have worked.  Yes it was a very reasonable thing for this course the project was good and if I had to re do it I would try JavaScript or .NET next time. Since I am used to working with Henrik and Oskar, it felt very good and coordinating was fine between us. <br>
                <br>
                Finish with a final paragraph with your thoughts on the course and what you think about the material and the guide (about 5-10 sentences). Provide feedback to teachers and suggest any improvement suggestions for upcoming course opportunities. Are you satisfied / dissatisfied? Will you recommend the course to your friends / colleagues? On a scale of 1-10, what grade do you give the course? <br>
                <br> 
                For this course I kinda liked it. I however did not like the fact that we wrote all our reports in html and then were requested to send it in in a document. I would have liked to DOM Parse the entire document to the report page instead. Otherwise the rest was amazing. I cannot say how nice it felt since it reminded me of year 1 when learning programming for the first time. My only feedback is for the report section sometimes it feels a bit tedious but I understand it is important but it would be nicer to have a document instead and just DOM parse it. I am satisfied and I would of course recommend it. I would give it a solid 9. If I can grade it from 1-5, then 5. <br>
                <br>
                What is your final TIL for this course? <br>
                <br>
                PHP stuff I guess. There were somethings I could not do with buttons/inputs due to it not working the same as JavaScript and as such it was harder. PHP can be interesting but it is definitely harder than what JavaScript is. JavaScript at least reminds me of Java which PHP do not.
