            <p>Did you before know about the techniques Git, GitHub, Markdown and/or GitHub Pages?</p>
            <p>I have known about Git and GitHub, the rest is new to me.
                I am accustomed to using built-in git push and pull on Intellij IDEA but Git bash also works fine with
                using a text editor.
                Though when it comes to using Markdown such as HTML, we have not used that so much until we got to third
                year.
                The GitHub pages is also a new experience for me.
            </p>

            <p>Have you ever created websites before?</p>
            <p>No I haven't, this is why I am excited. I have done some web related things in a previous course.
                RESTful API where we set up a Glassfish or Tomcat server to host locally.
                But mainly we used Tomcat or Glassfish to set up a java client to communicate to the server instead of
                using the browser.
            </p>

            <p>Briefly explain your experience and knowledge of web application development.</p>
            <p>I have no experience in web application besides some very simple applications.
                Such as RESTful Java Application with Tomcat Server.</p>

            <p>What is your TIL for this course section?</p>
            <p>Well it stands for "Today I learned", which I learned today that TIL.
                Learning to use Git Bash more and also that I got a warning of using password will be deprecated soon.
                Meaning that tokens are recomended, so I learned about that.
                For this course from Lecture 1, I learned that we're going to use several techniques such as PHP with
                MySQL.
                Also learning JavaScript with HTML.

            <p>Assignment 02: </p>

            <p>Have you any previous experience of HTML, CSS and/or JavaScript?</p>
            <p>No I haven't really used any of these before.
                I have heard of them often but we never had courses on them.
                It will be nice to learn about HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</p>

            <p>Explain the role of HTML, CSS and JavaScript in web development:</p>
            <p>HTML is the standard langauge markup langauge for websites.
                At the moment I have not read up on Markup so much yet.
                I know HTML is one such example but I am not used to it.
                CSS is used for making better looking websites.
                JavaScript is a programming langauge, used for coding logic on for instance in this case the web
                browser,
                like how things are built up via the browser.</p>

            <p>Give a brief explanation of how the browser, the HTTP protocol and the web server interacts:</p>
            <p>The browser is the client application that that person is using.
                And through it he or she can interact through the web.
                With requests and responses sent through TCP/IP and HTTP is the protocol.
                Which decides how it works for a URL syntax, like the
                http://www.address_here.com:port_here/queries_here.
                The client communicates through the internet and connects to a website through the web,
                that is a vast network of networks.</p>

            <p>What is your TIL for this course section?</p>
            <p>TIL'ed that HTML5 has some changes done with semantic elements to differienate like fonters and articles.
                I also learned that it is proper to define which charset the browser should read the document, it is a
                good practice.
                Even if it is not as important today as it was years ago it is still good to be aware of it in general.
