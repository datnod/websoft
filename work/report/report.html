<h2>S02</h2>
<a>Assignment 02: </a>
<br>
<p>Have you any previous experience of HTML, CSS and/or JavaScript?</p>
<br>
<p>No I haven't really used any of these before. I have heard of them often but we never had courses on them.</p>
<br>
<p>Explain the role of HTML, CSS and JavaScript in web development:</p>
<br>
<p>HTML is the standard langauge markup langauge for websites, as of at the moment I have not read up on Markup yet. CSS is used for making better looking websites. JavaScript is a programming langauge, used for coding logic on for instance in this case the web browser, like how things are built up via the browser.</p>
<br>
<p>Give a brief explanation of how the browser, the HTTP protocol and the web server interacts:</p>
<br>
<p>The browser is the client application that that person is using and through it he or she can interact through the web, with requests and responses sent through TCP/IP and HTTP is the protocol that decides how it works for a URL syntax, like the http://www.address_here.com:port_here/queries_here. The client communicates through the internet and connects to a website through the web that is a vast network of networks.</p>
<br>
<p>What is your TIL for this course section?</p>
<br>
<p>That HTML was a markup langauge and that markup is a way of making a document different from normal text.</p>
